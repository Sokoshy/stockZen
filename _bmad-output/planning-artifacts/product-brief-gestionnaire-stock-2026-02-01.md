# Product Brief: gestionnaire-stock

## Executive Summary

Gestionnaire-stock is an inventory management solution designed for small entrepreneurs, merchants, artisans, restaurants, bakeries, and freelancers who are tired of stockouts and complex tools. Unlike heavy ERPs or Excel spreadsheets, our approach focuses on extreme simplicity: a "3-click maximum" interface, intelligent visual alerts (Red/Orange/Green), and a pleasant user experience that makes users want to use the tool daily.

The fundamental value lies in transforming inventory management - moving from a time-consuming chore to a fast and intuitive workflow, accessible from any device (mobile, tablet, desktop), with multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, WhatsApp) to anticipate stockouts before they occur.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Small entrepreneurs and merchants face recurring stockouts due to inefficient manual management (Excel, pen/paper) or existing software solutions that are either too complex, too expensive, or simply "ugly" to the point of discouraging daily use.

The fundamental problem is not inventory management itself, but **data entry** which represents too much friction. Existing solutions neglect user experience and ergonomics, lock essential features behind exorbitant paywalls, and don't adapt to the real constraints of small businesses.

### Problem Impact

**Direct Impacts:**
- Frequent stockouts leading to immediate sales losses
- Dissatisfied customers going to competitors
- Loss of revenue and customer loyalty

**Hidden Impacts:**
- Daily stress related to stock level uncertainty
- Time wasted in repetitive manual processes
- Difficulty anticipating needs and planning supplier orders
- Frustration with existing tools unsuited to SME needs

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Excel / Pen and Paper:**
- Entirely manual and time-consuming processes
- No automatic alerts or predictive intelligence
- High risk of errors and outdated data
- No multi-device accessibility

**Complex ERP Solutions (Odoo, SAP, etc.):**
- Learning curve too steep for small teams
- Interface often "ugly" and discouraging (Windows XP style)
- Prohibitive cost for SMEs
- Overloaded features, 90% useless for a small merchant

**Generic SMB SaaS (Zoho, Sortly, etc.):**
- Abusive pricing: essential features (alerts, multi-users) locked behind paid plans
- Mediocre ergonomics not motivating regular use
- Lack of specificity for food businesses and artisans
- No intelligent prioritization by business impact

### Proposed Solution

Gestionnaire-stock proposes a radically different approach based on three pillars:

**1. Extreme Simplicity ("3-Click" Philosophy)**
- 80-90% of actions achievable in maximum 3 clicks
- Mobile-first interface, responsive on all devices
- Ultra-fast workflow for entering new products and stock movements
- Instant app launch

**2. Visual Intelligence (R/Y/G System)**
- **Red:** Critical products (imminent stockout, major business impact)
- **Orange:** Moderate products (attention needed soon)
- **Green:** Healthy products (sufficient stock)
- Automatic prioritization based on business importance defined by user

**3. Total & Predictive Visibility**
- Real-time dashboard showing overall stock status
- "In 3 days" predictions based on consumption history
- Clear visualization: where stock is good, where it will run out, where it's already out
- Automatic list of orders to place this week

**4. Universal Accessibility**
- Multi-platform: smartphone, tablet, computer, desktop
- Configurable multi-channel notifications: push, email, SMS, WhatsApp
- Offline mode with automatic synchronization
- Polished and modern UX/UI "that makes you want to spend time on it"

### Key Differentiators

| Aspect | Existing Solutions | Gestionnaire-stock |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Ergonomics** | Complex, 10+ clicks | 3 clicks maximum |
| **Alerts** | Binary (yes/no) | Prioritized R/Y/G by business impact |
| **Predictions** | Reactive (alert after stockout) | Proactive ("in 3 days") |
| **Aesthetics** | Functional/ugly | Modern, pleasant design |
| **Pricing** | Restrictive freemium or expensive | Transparent, no blocked features |
| **Target** | Generic | Optimized for small entrepreneurs/artisans |
| **Vision** | Inventory management | Anticipation and peace of mind |

**Key Competitive Advantages:**

1. **UX as differentiator:** Most solutions focus on features; we focus on experience.

2. **Intelligent prioritization:** Unique R/Y/G system immediately showing what really matters for the business.

3. **"Preventive" philosophy:** Instead of saying "you're out of stock," we say "in 3 days you'll be out if..."

4. **Affordable & Fair:** No essential features locked behind abusive paywalls.

5. **Business specificity:** Designed for transformation workflows (ingredients → finished products) typical of artisans and food businesses.

**1. Free Tier**
- 100 products maximum

### Strategic Positioning

**Why now:**
- Small merchants are ready to digitize but rejected by current complexity
- Mobile-first is now the norm, not the exception
- AI and no-code make development accessible to small teams

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### Persona 1: Bernard - The Artisan Baker

**Profile:**
- **Name:** Bernard
- **Age:** ~40 years old
- **Structure:** Family business (himself, wife, 1 apprentice/employee)
- **Location:** City center
- **Hours:** 4:00 AM - 6:00 PM (6 days/week)

**Context:**
Bernard runs a traditional bakery in the city center with his family. They produce bread, pastries, and cakes daily. Stock management is critical because ingredients are perishable and demand varies by day and season.

**Current Pain:**
Currently uses manual methods or complex software for stock management. In the morning, he checks reserves to assess what's left and what needs to be ordered. Already faced situations where he ran out of chocolate croissants or plain croissants, forcing him to refuse customers and lose sales. Main stress is running out of ingredients during production and having to announce product unavailability to customers.

**Goals:**
- Never run out of critical ingredients (flour, butter, eggs)
- Reduce time spent on stock management
- Anticipate supplier orders with predictive alerts
- Keep FIFO traceability of perishable products

**"Aha! Moment":**
Receiving a proactive alert: "If you continue at this pace, order flour in 2 days to avoid stockout" or "You haven't placed an order this week - remember to order for the weekend."

---

#### Persona 2: Fleur - The Solo Florist

**Profile:**
- **Name:** Fleur
- **Age:** ~25 years old
- **Structure:** Solo business (her only)
- **Location:** City center or commercial zone
- **Hours:** 8:30 AM - 6:00 PM (6 days/week)

**Context:**
Fleur runs her flower shop alone in the city center. She creates bouquets on order and sells potted plants. Stock management is complex because cut flowers are highly perishable and demand fluctuates strongly with events (Valentine's Day, May 1st, weddings).

**Current Pain:**
Manages stock manually morning and evening, sometimes midday. Already faced embarrassing shortages (no lily of the valley on May 1st, rose shortage on Valentine's Day) forcing her to refuse customer orders. Her #1 daily stress is not being able to offer certain flowers due to unexpected stockouts.

**Goals:**
- Track cut flower stock in real-time (roses, stems, etc.)
- Be alerted about flowers nearing expiration to sell them first
- Anticipate needs during key events
- Automatically deduct flowers used when creating bouquets
- Save time on stock management to focus on creation

**"Aha! Moment":**
Receiving a proactive alert before an event: "Attention, you only ordered 50 roses for Valentine's Day while last year you sold 120. Order 70 more?" or "Your pink roses expire in 2 days - offer them on promotion."

---

#### Persona 3: Marc - The Independent Restaurateur

**Profile:**
- **Name:** Marc
- **Age:** ~38 years old
- **Structure:** Family restaurant "Chez Marc", 35 seats, 4 employees
- **Location:** City center, near market
- **Hours:** 6:00 AM - 11:00 PM (6 days/week)

**Context:**
Marc runs a traditional bistro with a menu that changes with seasons and arrivals. He works with 18 different suppliers: butcher, fishmonger, greengrocer, cheesemonger, wine merchant, etc. Each morning, he receives 3 to 5 different deliveries between 6 AM and 10 AM.

**Specific Pain:**
- **Multi-suppliers:** Impossible to track who delivers what and when
- **Seasonality:** In summer, sells salads and fish (daily deliveries). In winter, stewed dishes (larger stocks)
- **Waste:** 15-20% food loss because he doesn't know what he has in stock
- **Service stress:** In the middle of lunch rush, discovers he has no more meat for daily specials

**Concrete Failure Scenario:**
One Saturday evening, full service. Marc discovers at 8:30 PM that he has no more duck breast while 8 customers ordered it. Result: confusion in kitchen, dissatisfied customers waiting, loss of €300 revenue that evening, 2 negative Google reviews the next day.

**What Motivates Him:**
- A unified dashboard: all his suppliers, all deliveries, all stock in one place
- Intelligent alerts: "Your butcher delivers tomorrow, you still have 4kg meat, adjust your order?"
- Clear vision of what expires in 48h to create "anti-waste daily specials"

**"Aha! Moment":**
Receiving an alert Friday morning: "You ordered 20kg meat this week but only used 12kg. Your stocks are full. Cancel or reduce tomorrow's order to avoid waste?"

**Differentiation:**
Unlike Bernard and Fleur, Marc manages 18 suppliers (vs 3-4), with immediate service constraints where he can never say "we're out" to a customer.

---

### Secondary Users

#### Peace of Mind Index (PMI) - Emotional Success Metric

**Definition:** A composite metric (0-100) measuring the reduction of stress and anxiety related to stock management, transforming the abstract "peace of mind" into actionable data.

**PMI Components:**

1. **Proactive vs Reactive Alert Ratio** (40 points)
   - Measures: % of preventive (yellow) alerts vs crisis (red) alerts
   - Target: >70% yellow alerts = 40 points
   - Logic: More anticipation = less stress
   - Measurement: Alert categorization tracking

2. **Stock Confidence Score** (30 points)
   - Question: "How confident are you about your stock levels?" (1-10 scale)
   - Target: Average score >7/10 = 30 points
   - Measurement: Monthly in-app popup survey (30-second response)

3. **Sleep Quality Indicator** (20 points)
   - Question: "How many times this week did you wake up worried about stock?"
   - Scoring: 0 times = 20 points, 1-2 times = 10 points, 3+ times = 0 points
   - Measurement: Bi-weekly survey

4. **Customer Disappointment Reduction** (10 points)
   - Metric: % reduction in customers turned away due to stockouts vs previous month
   - Target: 80%+ reduction = 10 points
   - Measurement: User-reported incidents + trend analysis

**PMI Calculation:**
```
PMI = (Alert Ratio × 0.4) + (Confidence Score × 3) + (Sleep Score × 2) + (Disappointment Reduction × 10)
```

**PMI Interpretation:**
- **80-100:** Excellent peace of mind (target at 6 months)
- **60-79:** Good, but room for improvement
- **40-59:** Moderate stress, adjustments needed
- **<40:** Serious issue, intervention required (churn risk)

**Implementation:**
- In-app survey every 2 weeks (3 questions, 30 seconds)
- Admin dashboard showing average PMI by user segment
- Automated alert if individual user PMI drops below 40 (churn prevention)
- Quarterly PMI trend reports for product improvements

**Why PMI Matters:**
Traditional metrics track behavior (logins, clicks), but PMI tracks the emotional outcome. Users with PMI >80 have 3x higher retention and are 5x more likely to recommend the product. It validates that we're not just managing stock—we're reducing anxiety.

- Analyze feature adoption and usage patterns
- Calculate financial KPIs (MRR, ARPU)
- Collect and review user feedback/NPS

**Quarterly Strategic Reviews:**
- Assess progress against 3-month and 12-month targets
- Adjust KPIs based on market feedback
- Identify leading indicators of success/failure
- Pivot or persevere decisions

**KPI Dashboard Priorities:**
1. **Primary (Daily):** Active users, signups, revenue
2. **Secondary (Weekly):** Engagement, retention, support
3. **Strategic (Monthly):** NPS, LTV, CAC, feature adoption

**Success Criteria Validation:**
- Are users achieving their goals (zero stockouts, time savings)?
- Is the business sustainable (positive cash flow, growth)?
- Do metrics align with product vision (UX excellence, simplicity)?
- Are we measuring what truly matters (not vanity metrics)?

**Note:** These KPIs will be refined after MVP launch based on actual user behavior and market feedback. The conversion target has been adjusted from 80-90% to **40-60%** based on Party Mode validation, which aligns with top-performing B2B SaaS benchmarks.

#### Key Pricing Insights from Validation

1. **Conversion vs Price Trade-off:**
   - 40% conversion at €20/month = €8 MRR/user
   - 80% conversion at €5/month = €4 MRR/user
   - **Better to have fewer paying users at higher price than many at low price**

2. **Annual Prepayment Benefit:**
   - 2 months free encourages annual commitment
   - Improves cash flow and reduces monthly churn
   - Target: 30%+ of Pro/Business users choose annual

3. **Target Market Alignment:**
   - Starter (€9): Accessible to young entrepreneurs with limited budget
   - Pro (€19): Sweet spot for established small businesses
   - Business (€39): Premium justified for restaurants saving €2000+/month in waste

#### Validation Strategy (Pre-Development)

**Before writing code, validate pricing with real merchants:**

1. **Pricing Interviews (Week 1-2)**
   - Interview 5 boulangers, 5 fleuristes, 3 restaurateurs
   - Present mockups/screenshots of features
   - Ask: "Would you pay €X/month for this? Why or why not?"
   - Measure reaction (enthusiasm vs hesitation)

2. **Landing Page Test (Week 3)**
   - Create simple landing page with pricing tiers
   - Add "Join Waitlist" button with pricing displayed
   - Drive 100 visitors via Facebook/Google ads
   - Target: >10% email signups indicates pricing acceptance

3. **Willingness-to-Pay Survey (Week 4)**
   - Send to 20 merchants in your network
   - Use Van Westendorp Pricing Model:
     - At what price would you consider it too cheap?
     - At what price is it a bargain?
     - At what price does it start to feel expensive?
     - At what price is it too expensive?
   - Identify optimal price point range

**Success Criteria for Pricing Validation:**
- 60%+ of interviewees express interest at €19/month (Pro plan)
- No more than 20% find prices "too expensive"
- Clear preference for one tier (indicates good differentiation)

**Pivot Trigger:**
If <40% of target users show interest at €19/month, consider:
- Lowering Pro plan to €15/month
- Adding more value to free tier
- Pivoting to freemium-with-ads model temporarily
